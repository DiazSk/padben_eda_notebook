The force is restricting applications to people who have lived in the county for at least the past 12 months.
The county's Police and Crime Commissioner, Marc Jones, said the advert had attracted a great deal of interest.
In a statement on the force's website, Chief Constable Neil Rhodes said he wanted ""the force to reflect the community it serves and for applicants to have an understanding of the county and issues facing the public of Lincolnshire"".
The force said it would also consider applications from those with strong connections to the county, such as members of the armed forces who have left the region to work in other areas.
More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire
The application process opened on Monday.
One employment lawyer has described the force's policy as ""potentially discriminatory"".
Mary Walker, a partner at Andrew Jackson Solicitors and an expert in employment law, said the force would have to decide if the locals-only policy was ""proportionate"" and ""legitimate"".
""Does the need for that local knowledge outweigh the potential of discrimination on other potential recruits?"" she said.

However HMM hasn't been spared from the woes bedevilling the sector. It recently announced a reorganisation plan too.
South Korea's shipping and shipbuilding industry is one of the hardest-hit by a prolonged downturn in global trade.
A drop in orders has led to overcapacity and depressed freight rates, as well as an increase in debts.

The South Korean government is now looking to undertake a painful reorganisation of the entire industry, which will require major retrenchments.
The ongoing restructuring is one of several reasons why we expect growth to be weak this year and next, Krystal Tan from Capital Economics said.
""The loss of tens of thousands of jobs certainly won't help economic sentiment,"" she added.
""But it is a relatively small number when set against the 26m people in employment in Korea so we're not likely to see a big spike in the unemployment rate.""","Hanjin's board unanimously voted on Wednesday to file for court protection, a company spokesman confirmed.

3854,hlpc,"West Yorkshire Police confirmed last month that 16,000 tickets issued by police community support officers (PCSO) were not valid due because of an ""administrative error"".
But, the force said there was ""no basis in law"" for refunds, which would have ""come from the public purse"".
Many of the drivers paid up without challenging the ticket's validity.
After a review of PCSO powers in March, the force found some PCSOs who joined the force several years ago were not initially given powers to issue parking tickets.
In a statement, police said ""an administrative error meant that the authorisation was invalid"".
The force's current records system, which goes back to 2006, found 16,000 tickets were affected, resulting in total of ¬£485,000 being paid to the courts.
The force admitted other tickets may have been issued in similar circumstances for up to three years earlier.
It said it had taken legal advice on the matter.
A spokesman said: ""We are now satisfied that there is no basis in law that would entitle anyone to such a refund, which would in any case have had to come from the public purse.
At the heart of this assessment is that motorists had opportunity to challenge the validity of the process in court at the time, and only those found guilty in these circumstances were penalised.
""If, however, motorists elected to pay the penalty they effectively accepted having committed the offence and opted out of the court process, thereby waiving their right to contest the matter.""
The force said the ""anomaly"" had since been corrected and PCSOs now had the full powers to issue the fines.","West Yorkshire Police recently admitted that 16,000 parking fines issued by their Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) were invalid due to an ""administrative error."" However, the police stated that there were no legal grounds for issuing refunds, as such payments would have to come from public funds. A significant number of drivers paid these fines without questioning their legality. Following a review of PCSO authority in March, it was discovered that some PCSOs, who had joined the force years prior, had not been properly authorised to issue parking tickets from the outset. Police acknowledged in a statement that ""an administrative error rendered the authorisation invalid."" The force's records, accessible back to 2006, revealed that 16,000 tickets were impacted, leading to a total of £485,000 being paid into the courts. The force also conceded that other fines might have been issued under similar incorrect circumstances up to three years earlier. They confirmed seeking legal counsel on the issue. A spokesperson explained that, after legal assessment, they are confident there are no legal grounds for refunds, which would otherwise use public money. The core reasoning is that drivers had the opportunity to dispute the tickets' validity in court at the time, and penalties were only imposed on those found guilty. By choosing to pay the fine, motorists effectively accepted responsibility for the offence and forfeited their right to challenge it legally.

Meanwhile, Fury will not face criminal charges from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) regarding alleged homophobic remarks. GMP received a complaint about his statements on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme but classified them as a ""hate incident"" rather than a ""hate crime.""

Following his victory over Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf, Fury stated: ""I'm not sexist. I believe a woman's best place is in the kitchen and on her back. That's my personal belief. Making me a good cup of tea, that's what I believe."" The new world champion had also previously claimed that the legalisation of paedophilia, alongside the decriminalisation of homosexuality and abortion, would signal ""the devil come home."" Subsequently, the Manchester-born fighter clarified, ""Tyson Fury loves his fellow humans. He doesn't hate anybody.""

Greg Rutherford, a fellow nominee for BBC Sports Personality of the Year and a long jump champion, initially intended to withdraw from the event due to Fury's comments but later changed his mind. Furthermore, Fury, who captured the WBA, IBF, and WBO titles on November 28 by defeating Klitschko, was stripped of his IBF belt on Tuesday. This occurred because he opted for a rematch with Klitschko instead of fulfilling the IBF's mandatory defence against Ukrainian Vyacheslav Glazkov.",0.2234295904636383,0.97503954,0.16188164489599655,0.6867637893266448,0.31323621067335516,0.3130374367835356,0.6618962432915922,0.33810375670840775,0.3126462088895004,0.9461988,0.05380118,0.6036866359447005,0.3963133640552995,0.41252955082742315,0.22226571607220513,Low Drift

Davies said: ""In a couple of the games in this campaign we have started off a bit slowly.
""We have talked about the first 20 minutes. We have got to come out all guns blazing. That is going to be massive for us.
""We are quite confident and comfortable playing anywhere.
""We had a couple of good performances at Twickenham in the World Cup, so it is not a place we are scared to go.""","Scrum-half Rhys Webb is set to return to the Welsh squad from the bench, marking his first appearance since suffering a foot injury last September. Gareth Davies affirmed that Webb's immediate return was anticipated once he regained fitness, noting that the added competition creates ""a bit of extra pressure"" which he finds enjoyable.

Currently, England leads Wales by one point at the top of the table, having secured three victories from three games. Both players have a history of impactful performances against England: Webb famously scored a try in Wales' 2015 Six Nations win in Cardiff, while Davies delivered a crucial late try in their 2015 World Cup victory, a tournament Webb missed following surgery. Davies, 25, has accumulated six tries in 12 Wales appearances, in contrast to 27-year-old Webb's five tries in 16 games.

Under new coach Eddie Jones, England boasts an unblemished record. Wales, meanwhile, rebounded from an opening draw in Ireland to defeat Scotland and France. If England overcomes Wales, they will travel to France on March 19th, aiming for their first Grand Slam since 2003. Conversely, a Welsh triumph on Saturday would position them to win the championship for the third time in five years by simply defeating Italy at home.

Davies admitted that Wales has started some games in this campaign slowly. He stressed the importance of the initial 20 minutes, stating, ""We have got to come out all guns blazing. That is going to be massive for us."" He also conveyed confidence in playing on any ground, referencing their strong performances at Twickenham during the World Cup as evidence that it is ""not a place we are scared to go.""",0.24395965039730072,0.97024196,0.18281921611029003,0.6192673368663963,0.38073266313360365,0.38055342512003887,0.5441696113074205,0.4558303886925795,0.43490078825767875,0.92286557,0.07713443,0.49572649572649574,0.5042735042735043,0.5012004801920769,0.27278237234171754,Low Drift
3887,hlpc,"Six policemen died in a gunfight during an operation to evict the farmers from land they had been occupying.
Eleven protesters were also killed.
The deaths deepened political tensions in Paraguay and were used by congress to oust the left-wing President Fernando Lugo.
Four men received sentences of between 18 and 30 years in jail, while a further seven men and women were given sentences of between four and six years.
The court heard how the clashes occurred near the city of Curuguaty in Canindeyu province in the east of Paraguay when a group of around 250 riot police were sent to clear a group of around 70 subsistence farmers off a property belonging to an agricultural company called Campos Morumbi.
The farmers had occupied the land as part of a demonstration in favour of agrarian reform.
The Paraguayan prosecution service did not investigate the deaths of the farmers who died during the eviction.
Local and international human rights organizations alleged there had been judicial irregularities during the trial.
Five of the accused had gone on hunger strike for more than 30 days.
√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄπLand ownership has long formed the basis for bloody disputes in Paraguay.
According to the 2008 census, 2.6% of landowners hold 85.5% of Paraguay's land while 91.4% of small farmers, with properties smaller than 20 hectare, hold only 6% of the agricultural land.
Campaigners for agrarian reform have focussed on large agricultural conglomerates involved in the export of soy as being the main cause of the unequal land distribution in Paraguay.
The events at Curuguaty became the basis for the opposition Colorado Party to push for the impeachment of President Lugo whom they blamed for the killings.","A violent clash resulted in the deaths of six police officers and eleven protestors during an operation to remove farmers from land they had occupied. These fatalities escalated political tensions in Paraguay, subsequently leading to President Fernando Lugo's removal from office by congress.

In the aftermath, four men were sentenced to 18 to 30 years in prison, with an additional seven individuals (men and women) receiving jail terms of four to six years. Testimony revealed the confrontation took place near Curuguaty, in eastern Paraguay's Canindeyu province. Approximately 250 riot police were dispatched to clear about 70 subsistence farmers from a Campos Morumbi agricultural company property. The farmers had been occupying the land to advocate for agrarian reform.

Notably, the Paraguayan prosecution service failed to investigate the farmers' deaths, and both local and international human rights organizations raised concerns about judicial irregularities throughout the trial. Furthermore, five of the defendants undertook a hunger strike lasting over 30 days.

Unequal land ownership has historically fueled violent conflicts in Paraguay. A 2008 census highlighted this disparity: a mere 2.6% of landowners control 85.5% of the country's land, while 91.4% of small farmers (with holdings under 20 hectares) possess only 6% of agricultural land. Advocates for agrarian reform largely attribute this imbalance to major agricultural conglomerates specializing in soy exports. The Curuguaty incident then served as the catalyst for the opposition Colorado Party to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Lugo, holding him responsible for the fatalities.",0.41056376695632935,0.9157187,0.35273033991219827,0.502964706497665,0.497035293502335,0.4968897176104399,0.5103189493433397,0.48968105065666034,0.4700533987588396,0.9262004,0.07379961,0.3983402489626556,0.6016597510373445,0.5580985915492958,0.40502682722117483,Medium Drift

The long-lost station only served passengers from 1902 to 1915 before shutting for good.
The ¬£6.5bn Thameslink Programme is rebuilding railway lines from New Cross Gate through London Bridge to Blackfriars and St Pancras.
Located on a viaduct above Rotherhithe New Road, Southwark Park was one of several stations in the area, including Spa Road, which closed because of competition from trams and buses and the outbreak of World War One.
The station was discovered as engineers constructed the Bermondsey Dive Under, which will see two Victorian viaducts partially-demolished and rebuilt to allow trains from south east London and Kent to dive down, under a new route carrying Thameslink services from Croydon.
Project manager Greg Thornett said: ""We uncovered the footings for the former platforms while we were preparing the top of the viaduct for new track and we are now working up in the roof space of the former ticket hall to fill in the old skylights, ready to carry the final track alignment.
""Much of the existing stretch of viaduct will be replaced by the ramps into and out of the new dive under, but the arch that used to house the old booking hall will remain.""","During the extensive Thameslink Programme, engineers have unearthed the forgotten ticket hall and platforms of Southwark Park station. This long-vanished station operated briefly from 1902 until its permanent closure in 1915. The £6.5 billion Thameslink initiative is a major redevelopment effort, rebuilding railway lines that extend from New Cross Gate through London Bridge to Blackfriars and St Pancras.

Perched on a viaduct above Rotherhithe New Road, Southwark Park was among several local stations, including Spa Road, that ceased operations. Their closures were primarily due to increasing competition from trams and buses, exacerbated by the outbreak of World War One.

I love and miss you forever and ever my girl.""","A teenager faces charges for drug distribution in East Calder, where authorities are investigating the death of 15-year-old Dione Melville. Emergency services responded to a residence in the town on Sunday morning, but tragically, Dione was pronounced deceased a short while later. Investigators currently classify the death as ""unexplained."" As a precautionary measure, two other 15-year-old girls were transported to St John's Hospital in Livingston.

Dione was a student at West Calder High School. Acting head teacher Lisa Grubb stated that Dione was a popular girl, and this period is understandably distressing for her loved ones and friends. Ms. Grubb added that Dione was an ambitious young woman with aspirations of pursuing a career in hairdressing and the beauty sector upon graduating this summer. She was highly focused on her future, and the entire school community extends its deepest sympathies to Dione's family and friends during this profoundly sorrowful period.

Professor Duncan Wingham said the row had ""put a smile"" on people's faces.
But MPs asked if he would be made to ""walk the plank"" by ministers, who named it after Sir David Attenborough.
Prof Wingham was giving evidence to the Commons Science and Technology Committee about the episode, which attracted huge public interest and divided opinion after Boaty McBoatface was passed over.
He said that ministers' decision to name the vessel after the eminent zoologist and broadcaster - the option which came fourth in the poll - while allowing Boaty McBoatface to live on by naming a remotely operated sub-sea vehicle after it was an ""eloquent compromise"".
Asked by Conservative MP Nicola Blackwood what the episode had done for public engagement in science, the academic said it had attracted ""extraordinary attention"" which could only be regarded as an ""incredible success"".
""We could make the claim that we are probably the best-known research council in the world,"" he said.
""We could make the claim that because of that there are hundreds of thousands of people, not only in the UK but around the world, who know about us and the science that we have done

The award follows a judgement from an employment tribunal in Dundee.
Lawyers said that despite the company directors being under an obligation to provide employees with at least 45 days' notice - as more than 100 workers were losing their jobs - this was ignored, meaning each employee was entitled to sue for compensation.
However, acting alone would have meant each affected worker lodging ""an extremely complex"" and expensive employment tribunal claim, so they made a joint bid.
David Martyn, a senior employment lawyer at Thompsons, the firm that represented the workers, said: ""The more notice the workforce have to prepare for these devastating changes, the better they can organise their financial responsibilities to soften the blow.
""This award of compensation will be paid by UK administration service.
""That means that the taxpayer has picked up the tab because company directors have played fast and loose with the rules.
""This has to stop and I believe we need to see more criminal prosecutions of companies that behave this way.""
Paul Reilly, Unite branch secretary said: ""This is a great result for my members and it goes a long way towards the hurt that happened.""","374 workers were made redundant after Tullis Russell Papermakers, located in Markinch, Fife, entered administration in April 2015. Subsequently, each affected individual was awarded eight weeks' pay as compensation. This settlement came after a ruling by an employment tribunal in Dundee.

According to legal representatives, the company directors failed to meet their legal duty to give at least 45 days' notice, a requirement when over 100 staff are made redundant. This neglect meant that every employee had grounds to pursue compensation. Nevertheless, individual claims to the employment tribunal would have been ""extremely complex"" and costly for each worker, leading them to collectively pursue the claim.

David Martyn, a senior employment solicitor from Thompsons, the firm representing the former employees, commented: ""The more preparation time employees have before such significant changes, the better equipped they are to manage their finances and lessen the impact. This compensation payout will be covered by the UK's administration service. Consequently, taxpayers are bearing the cost due to the directors' disregard for regulations. This practice must cease, and I believe stronger criminal charges should be brought against companies acting in this manner.""

Paul Reilly, Unite branch secretary, stated: ""This is an excellent outcome for our members, offering significant redress for the hardship endured.""",0.3517555892467499,0.9381341,0.2927548496917228,0.4251036665838422,0.5748963334161579,0.5747732932811118,0.3981693363844394,0.6018306636155606,0.5865164583700052,0.9271367,0.07286328,0.3392070484581498,0.6607929515418502,0.5448807854137447,0.40791086014525707,Medium Drift
3965,hlpc,"The move follows a rise in the number of oil and gas operators using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to conduct inspections and other offshore tasks.
The guidelines were developed by industry and aviation safety experts and UAS operators.
They cover best practice, procedures and the certification needed to be compliant with UAS regulations.
Oil and Gas UK's health, safety and environment director Mick Borwell said: ""A small but increasing number of oil and gas operators are using UAS for inspections predominantly, but also for aerial photography, surveying and security.
""The technology is particularly attractive for its use in improving safety.
""For example, sending unmanned aircraft instead of people into confined spaces to conduct inspections reduces risk, and is also effective and efficient.
""We expect their usage to grow.""
Mr Borwell said the new guidelines aimed to be consistent with safety and operating standards already adopted on the UK Continental Shelf for offshore oil and gas production and helicopter flight operations.
He added: ""The intention is to encourage offshore operators planning on using this emerging technology to think about the whole operating and safety system offshore and not just the air vehicle.""","This initiative stems from an increasing trend among oil and gas companies to deploy unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for offshore inspections and various other operations. These guidelines were collaboratively created by specialists in industry, aviation safety, and UAS operation. They outline optimal practices, operational procedures, and the necessary certifications to ensure adherence to UAS regulations.

Mick Borwell, Oil and Gas UK's health, safety, and environment director, observed that while the number is currently small, more oil and gas operators are increasingly utilizing UAS primarily for inspections, but also for aerial photography, surveying, and security purposes. This technology is especially appealing due to its capacity to enhance safety. For instance, deploying unmanned aircraft for inspections in confined spaces instead of human personnel significantly mitigates risks, proving both effective and efficient. We anticipate their deployment will expand.

Mr. Borwell stated that these new guidelines are intended to align with the existing safety and operational benchmarks already in place on the UK Continental Shelf for offshore oil and gas extraction and helicopter flight activities.

However, those with tickets for the affected shows can use them for the rescheduled performances. The original Facebook statement advised ticket holders to keep their existing tickets for redemption on the new dates. It remains uncertain if Manilow will be able to attend Monday evening's Grammy Awards as scheduled. The New York-born artist, who rose to prominence in the 1970s, enjoys a global fanbase and is widely recognized for hits like ""Mandy"" and ""Copacabana."" He has faced various health challenges throughout his career, including needing ongoing dental treatment after a benign tumor ruptured in his mouth in 1986. His current ""One Last Time, One Last Tour,"" which spans the UK and North America, is intended to be his final live concert series, concluding on June 23 at London's O2 Arena.",0.3512837886810303,0.9382999,0.2922736841239837,0.6074583957598311,0.39254160424016893,0.3923657841545655,0.5727272727272726,0.42727272727272736,0.40524475524475534,0.9410756,0.058924377,0.5425531914893617,0.45744680851063835,0.525984251968504,0.3348863183542544,Low Drift
